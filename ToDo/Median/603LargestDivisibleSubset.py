# Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies: Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.
#
#  Notice
#
# If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

# Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
# Example
# Given nums = [1,2,3], return [1,2] or [1,3]
#
# Given nums = [1,2,4,8], return [1,2,4,8]
