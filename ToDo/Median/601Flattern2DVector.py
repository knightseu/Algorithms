#
#  Description
#  Notes
#  Testcase
#  Judge
# Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector.
#
# Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
# Example
# Given 2d vector =
#
# [
#   [1,2],
#   [3],
#   [4,5,6]
# ]
# By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,2,3,4,5,6].
