#
# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
#
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
#
# Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
#
# You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
#
# Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
# Example
# n = 10, I pick 4 (but you don't know)
#
# Return 4. Correct !
