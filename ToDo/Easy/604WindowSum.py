# Given an array of n integer, and a moving window(size k), move the window at each iteration from the start of the array, find the sum of the element inside the window at each moving.

# Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
# Example
# For array [1,2,7,8,5], moving window size k = 3.
# 1 + 2 + 7 = 10
# 2 + 7 + 8 = 17
# 7 + 8 + 5 = 20
# return [10,17,20]
